### 🔧 Exadata Cloud Management Responsibilities

| Responsibility Layer       | Managed By | Description |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure (up to hypervisor)** | Oracle     | Physical compute/storage servers, RDMA network, hypervisor, infrastructure patching, security updates |
| **Guest VM (above hypervisor)**       | Customer   | OS, Grid Infrastructure, Database Homes, customer data, schemas, encryption keys, access control |

📌 **Oracle cannot access guest VMs.**  
🔐 **Customers fully manage their environment inside the VM.**

---

### ⚙️ Guest VM Responsibilities

The **guest VM** contains:

- 🧠 Oracle Grid Infrastructure
- 🗄️ Oracle Database Home and DB software
- 🔐 Data, schemas, encryption keys
- 🔁 Cloud automation agents

Customers can:

- Install/manage additional software
- Manage user access
- Use UI, CLI, REST API to control provisioning, patching, scaling, backups, etc.

> 🧩 Supports Oracle Database versions up to **23ai**

### 🤖 Cloud Automation & Lifecycle Management

Exadata Database Service provides a **powerful automation toolkit** for:

| Operation                 | Supported |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| ✅ Provision DB systems   | ✔️        |
| 🔁 Scale up/down resources | ✔️        |
| 🛠️ Patch OS, Grid, DB Homes| ✔️        |
| 💾 Backup & Recovery       | ✔️        |
| 🌐 HA & DR via Data Guard | ✔️        |

📈 Automation ensures consistency, reduces manual errors, and accelerates time-to-deployment for DBAs.

### 🖥️ Exadata Cloud Infrastructure Overview

| Component                  | Role |
|---------------------------|------|
| **DB Servers**            | Hosts VMs (with DB Homes, GI, cloud tools) |
| **Storage Servers**       | Houses Exadata storage features |
| **RDMA Network (RoCE)**   | Internal high-speed compute-to-storage communication |
| **Client/Backup Network** | 50 Gbps external network for backups, data loads, and Data Guard |
| **Cloud Ops Network**     | Secure access for Oracle cloud team (infra only) |

🏗️ Scale-out architecture: Independently scale DB or storage servers.

### 🔌 Exadata Cloud@Customer Architecture

> For customers who **must keep data on-prem** (due to regulations, latency, or readiness)

| Component                   | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Exadata DB Servers**     | Located in your local data center |
| **Local Control Plane**    | 2 servers connect to Oracle Cloud for telemetry & control |
| **Secure Tunnel to OCI**   | REST API calls and monitoring from OCI to on-prem |
| **Customer Apps**          | Connect via internal network (no public internet exposure) |
| **Cloud Ops (Oracle)**     | Can access infra **only** if needed, under auditing and access control |

🛡️ **You get full OCI cloud automation experience**, but **your data never leaves your data center.**

### 🌍 Public Cloud vs Cloud@Customer

| Feature                             | Exadata in OCI | Exadata Cloud@Customer |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Data location                       | Oracle Cloud   | Customer's data center  |
| Oracle-managed infrastructure       | ✔️             | ✔️                      |
| Customer-managed guest VMs          | ✔️             | ✔️                      |
| OCI console/API/CLI for control     | ✔️             | ✔️                      |
| Local control plane                 | ❌             | ✔️                      |
| Same lifecycle tools (provision, patch, scale) | ✔️ | ✔️                      |
| Suitable for regulated industries   | ⚠️ (depends)   | ✅                      |

### 🔐 Security & Access Control

- 🛡️ **Guest VM**: Customers control access, software, keys
- 🛡️ **Infrastructure**: Oracle Cloud Ops can access **only if needed**
- 🔍 **Auditing & access logs** available to customers
- 📜 Policies ensure **regulatory compliance**
