### 💼 Licensing Models

Oracle offers **two flexible licensing options** to match your business needs:

| Model               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **License Included (LI)** | Subscribe to Oracle DB licenses as part of Exadata Database Service. Includes **all EE features**, **Enterprise Manager packs**, and **database options**. Ideal for customers without Oracle licenses or those expanding usage. |
| **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** | Use existing on-prem Oracle DB licenses. Minimizes cost by leveraging prior investments. Customers receive access to key features **without needing extra license entitlements**. |

✅ BYOL includes rights to use:

- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Oracle Data Safe
- Diagnostics Pack
- Tuning Pack
- Data Masking and Subsetting Pack
- Real Application Testing

❗ Oracle **Standard Edition is not supported** on Exadata Database Service.

### 📈 Vertical OCPU Scaling = Lower Costs

Unlike on-prem systems, **Exadata Database Service lets you scale OCPUs (cores) up or down** *without disruption*:

| Feature                     | On-Prem                     | Exadata Database Service        |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Peak workload sizing       | Pre-purchased (overprovisioned) | Scale up temporarily |
| Underutilized CPUs         | Wasted resources             | Deallocate to save cost         |
| Licensing cost             | Static, high                 | Dynamic, usage-based            |
| Downtime during scaling    | Usually required             | **Zero downtime**               |

💡 You pay only for what you use. Scaling is fully **online** and **instantaneous**.

### 🛡️ Oracle's Defense-in-Depth Security Model

Oracle secures Exadata at **every layer** of the stack:

| Layer                | Security Feature |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **Data Layer**       | TDE, masking, redaction, Database Vault |
| **OS/VM Layer**      | Secure baselines, token-based SSH, minimal packages |
| **Network Layer**    | VCNs/VLANs, encrypted DB connections, isolated client/backup traffic |
| **Database Layer**   | Data Safe, Firewall, Key Vault |
| **Control Plane**    | IAM, MFA, policies, compartments, audit logging |

🔒 Exadata is compliant with:

- FedRAMP
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS
- And other industry regulations

---

### 🔍 Identity & Access Management (IAM)

OCI provides a **robust access model** using:

- **Users / Groups**
- **Policies**
- **Compartments**
- **Instance / Resource principals**
- **Federated identity**
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

📌 All access to resources and services is governed by **granular IAM policies**, fully auditable and configurable.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Operator Access Control (OAC)

For regulated industries, **OAC** provides fine-grained, monitored access for Oracle Cloud Operations (Cloud Ops) staff:

| Capability                          | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| 🕓 Time-bound access                | Grant operator access for a set time only |
| 🔑 Privilege control               | Assign specific permissions |
| 📹 Live monitoring & recording     | View Oracle staff actions in real-time |
| ❌ Emergency termination           | Instantly revoke access and kill sessions |

⚖️ This gives customers full visibility, accountability, and regulatory confidence when using **Exadata Cloud@Customer**.
