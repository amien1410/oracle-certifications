# 🔐 Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service – Security Overview

Welcome to the security module of **Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service**, presented by Oracle University. In this lesson, we’ll cover the key security mechanisms that protect your data and ensure proper access control across your cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🛡️ Security at a Glance

Oracle NoSQL Cloud Service incorporates **industry-standard** security principles and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services to safeguard your data:

### ✅ Key Areas Covered:
1. **Encryption** – Protecting your data at rest and in transit
2. **Authentication** – Verifying identities
3. **Authorization** – Controlling access to resources
4. **Governance** – Managing resource isolation and billing visibility

---

## 🔒 Encryption

### At Rest
- Data is encrypted automatically using Oracle-managed keys
- Helps prevent unauthorized access to stored data
- Compliant with enterprise-grade data security policies

### In Transit
- All network communication is encrypted using **TLS**
- Ensures data integrity and confidentiality between clients and cloud services

---

## 👤 Authentication

Oracle leverages **OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for authentication:

- Secure login via IAM Users, Groups, and Policies
- Supports API key-based access and federated identity (e.g., SSO, OAuth)
- Enables multi-factor authentication (MFA)

---

## 🗂️ Authorization & Access Control

OCI IAM allows for **fine-grained access control** through **policies**:

```sql
Allow group DataAdmins to manage nosql-tables in compartment Analytics
```

## 🔑 Access Control & Governance

Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service provides powerful **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** features to ensure secure and organized access:

### 🛡️ Fine-Grained Authorization
- ✅ **SQL-like policies** for defining access rules in a human-readable format
- 🔄 **Role-based access control (RBAC)** at the **compartment** level
- 🔒 Supports the **principle of least privilege** — granting only the minimum permissions necessary

---

## 🧱 Compartment Governance

A **compartment** is a logical container in OCI used to isolate and manage resources effectively.

| 🔧 Use Case | 💡 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| 🎯 **Access Management** | Assign different teams or roles access to specific resources |
| 💰 **Billing & Usage Tracking** | Monitor costs and usage per compartment (project/team) |
| 🧩 **Resource Organization** | Keep your cloud architecture clean, modular, and manageable |

## 🧾 Summary

| Feature            | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 **Encryption**   | Secures data at rest and in motion using strong standards |
| 👥 **Authentication** | IAM users, API keys, and federated login (e.g., SSO) |
| 🧾 **Authorization** | Policy-based, fine-grained access control         |
| 📦 **Compartment**  | Logical isolation for resources, access, and billing |
