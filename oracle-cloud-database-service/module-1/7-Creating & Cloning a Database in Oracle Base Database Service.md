## 💾 Creating & Cloning a Database in Oracle Base Database Service

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Create Database from Backup

Oracle Base Database Service allows you to **provision a new DB system** by restoring from an existing backup, including point-in-time recovery.

#### ✅ Use Cases:

| Scenario                              | Supported? |
|---------------------------------------|------------|
| Full DB restore from backup           | ✅ Yes      |
| Restore selected PDBs only            | ✅ Yes      |
| Point-in-time recovery (timestamp)    | ✅ Yes      |

#### 🛠️ How-To (Console):

1. Navigate to **Database Details Page**
2. In the **Resources section**, click **Backups**
3. Locate your desired backup → click the **three dots (⋮)** → select **Create Database**
4. Or, use **More Actions > Create Database from Backup** for point-in-time restore
5. Choose:
   - Latest full backup  
   - OR enter **timestamp** for point-in-time recovery
6. Click **Create** to start provisioning

🧠 *Note: Only 1 CDB per DB System is allowed, but multiple PDBs can be restored.*

### 🧬 Clone a DB System

Cloning lets you **duplicate an existing DB system** with the same configuration (compute, storage, and DB volumes) at a specific point in time.

#### 🧠 Key Facts:

- 🪄 Cloning replicates:
  - VM shape
  - Storage software (LVM or ASM)
  - DB data (CDB/PDBs, volumes)
- 🔐 Encryption: If using *customer-managed encryption*, the **same key version** is used.
- 🔗 **Data Guard** not cloned: Must clone from the **primary** DB system.
- 🧱 RAC Systems: Cloning re-creates Oracle Grid Infrastructure, but:
  - ❌ Custom `clusterware resources`, `VIPs`, or `services` are *not copied*

#### 🛠️ How-To (Console):

1. Go to your **DB Systems Page**
2. Click the **name** of the DB system to clone
3. On the **Details Page**, click **Clone**
4. Fill in:
   - 📛 Display name
   - 🔐 New **SSH keys**
   - 🆔 Admin password
   - 🧾 License type (License Included or BYOL)
   - 🌐 Network & VCN info
   - 🗃️ Database info
5. Click **Clone DB System** to begin

🧪 **Pro Tip**:
Cloning systems with **ASM/Grid** takes longer than **LVM** due to extra infrastructure setup.

### 🧠 TL;DR

| Feature               | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Create from Backup | Use console or API to create new DB system from existing backup        |
| ⏱️ PITR Support       | Choose specific restore **timestamp** during creation                  |
| 🧬 Clone DB System     | Recreates compute + storage + DB setup (minus custom RAC elements)     |
| 🔒 Encryption Keys     | Reused from source DB system (for customer-managed encryption)         |
| 🚫 Not Cloned         | Data Guard config, custom RAC services, VIPs                           |
