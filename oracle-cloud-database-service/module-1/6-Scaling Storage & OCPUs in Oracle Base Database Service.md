## 📏 Scaling Storage & OCPUs in Oracle Base Database Service

---

### 🧱 Scale Storage (Block Volumes)

Oracle Base Database Service supports **online storage scaling** to handle increasing application and backup needs. However, there are **limitations and best practices** to consider.

#### ✅ Key Points:

- 📦 **Storage scaling is online**: No downtime or reboot needed.
- 🔄 **Independent of OCPU scaling**: Must be scaled separately.
- ⛔ **You cannot reduce storage**: Only *scale-up* is allowed.
- ⚠️ **Storage type & management software (LVM/ASM)** cannot be changed during scaling.

#### 🧰 Storage Components:

| Component         | Used For                           | Scaling Allowed? |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| `Available Data Storage` | App/database files                 | ✅ Yes (scale up only) |
| `Recovery Area Storage`  | Backups and recovery files         | ✅ Yes (scale up only) |

#### 🛠️ How to Scale:

1. Navigate to your **DB System Details Page**
2. Locate the **Scale Storage** section
3. Use the **dropdown menu** to select the new size for:
   - `Available Data Storage`
   - `Recovery Area Storage`
4. Click **Update**

### ⚙️ Scale OCPUs (CPU Cores)

Compute scaling allows you to **increase or decrease** the number of OCPUs for flexible shapes, or **reconfigure fixed shapes** by changing VM shape.

#### 🧠 Important Notes:

- 🪄 **OCPU scaling granularity depends on shape type**:
  - **Flexible Shapes**: Choose 1–64 OCPUs (1 OCPU increments)
  - **Fixed Shapes**: Must switch to another shape
- 🔁 **Processor type cannot be changed** during OCPU scaling
- 🔄 **Rolling reboot for RAC systems**: Each node restarts one-by-one

#### 🛠️ How to Scale OCPUs:

1. Go to your **DB System Details Page**
2. Click **Change Shape**
3. For *Flex Shapes*:
   - Use slider or dropdown to pick OCPUs (1–64)
4. For *Fixed Shapes* (e.g., Intel X7 series):
   - Choose another compatible shape with fixed OCPU count
5. Click **Change Shape** to apply
6. ⏱ **Downtime Alert**: VMs will reboot to apply the changes

### ⚖️ Best Practices for Scaling

| Task                        | Best Practice |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Scaling storage            | Monitor usage and plan ahead — scaling down isn't possible |
| Scaling OCPUs              | Use Flex shapes if workload varies frequently |
| RAC environments           | Expect rolling restarts during shape changes |
| Production workloads       | Schedule scaling during maintenance windows (for fixed shapes) |

---

📌 **TL;DR Summary:**
- Scale **storage** online with zero downtime, but only up.
- Scale **OCPUs** easily with Flex shapes, cautiously with Fixed shapes.
- Use OCI Console's **Change Shape** and **Update Storage** actions.
- Understand shape & licensing limitations before making changes.
