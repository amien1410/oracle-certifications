## üéØ Overview

Even though **Autonomous Database** automates most traditional DBA tasks, **Application DBAs** are still responsible for ensuring performance, diagnosing issues, and maintaining security‚Äîespecially in **dedicated infrastructure deployments (ADB-D)**.

This lesson highlights the **monitoring tools and practices** available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for managing Autonomous Database Dedicated.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Role of the Application DBA

Key monitoring and diagnostic tasks:

* Database lifecycle operations (provision, stop, start)
* Performance diagnostics and trend analysis
* Creating alerts and monitoring capacity
* Cloning and data movement
* Storage & CPU scaling
* On-demand backups and restores
