# 🧠 Using Graphs in Oracle Autonomous Database

**Instructor:** Michelle
**Lesson Focus:** How to model, analyze, and gain insights from graph data in Oracle Autonomous Database using the **Property Graph model**.

## 📌 What Are Graphs?

* **Graph = Vertices + Edges**

  * **Vertices** = entities (e.g., people, accounts, customers)
  * **Edges** = relationships between them (e.g., transactions, purchases)

🔄 Graphs let you:

* Make **relationships explicit**
* Discover **hidden patterns**
* Analyze complex networks of connections

## 🏦 Example: Banking Graph

| Table          | Becomes in Graph                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Accounts`     | Vertices                                |
| `Transactions` | Edges (e.g., cash transfer from A to B) |

Another example:

* **Customer buys product** = edge between customer (vertex) and product (vertex)

## 🔍 Why Use Graphs?

Graphs are powerful for answering **relational and behavioral questions** in your data:

### 🎯 Key Insight Areas

| Insight Type                   | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔺 **Anomaly Detection**       | E.g., Cash transfers going through many intermediaries → possible fraud |
| 👥 **Community Detection**     | Identify groups of tightly connected users (for churn or marketing)     |
| 🛍️ **Product Recommendation** | Suggest products liked by others in the same community                  |
| 🌐 **Influencer Detection**    | Find central or influential nodes in a social or business network       |
| 🛣️ **Path Analysis**          | Check if two accounts are indirectly connected (via multiple edges)     |
| ♻️ **Cycle Detection**         | Discover loops in transactions or dependencies                          |

## 🏭 Industry Applications

| Industry           | Use Case                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 💰 Finance         | Fraud detection, money laundering, transaction path tracing  |
| 🛍️ Retail         | Product recommendation, churn analysis, targeted marketing   |
| 👮 Law Enforcement | Find **hidden connections** among individuals/entities       |
| 🏗️ Manufacturing  | Model **Bill of Materials**, perform **dependency analysis** |
| 📡 Telecom         | Analyze network graphs, optimize services, detect anomalies  |

## 🧩 Oracle Property Graph Model

* **Flexible**: Vertices and edges can have **properties** (metadata)
* **Schema-optional**: You can build graphs from structured or semi-structured data
* **Powerful tooling**:

  * Query
  * Analyze
  * Visualize

> Any dataset with entities and relationships can become a graph!

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* Graphs are a **powerful way to model relationships** between entities.
* Oracle Autonomous Database supports **Property Graphs** natively.
* Enables **fraud detection, influence analysis, churn prediction**, and more.
* Applicable across **many industries** with mission-critical insights.

> 💡 Oracle Graph technology helps you **discover patterns you can’t see in tabular data**.
