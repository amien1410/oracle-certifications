**Instructor:** Michelle
**Lesson Objective:** Understand how to securely and efficiently share data using Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) — without duplication.

## 📌 What Is Data Sharing?

**Data Sharing** = Making **data available** to one or more recipients for use.

### 🧱 Traditional Methods:

* Exporting files (e.g. CSV)
* Shared storage
* Copying/moving data

### ❌ Challenges with Traditional Methods:

* Data duplication → harder to maintain freshness
* Manual syncs = labor-intensive
* Increased risk to **security** and **governance**
* Difficult to manage **access control** and **compliance**

## ✅ Benefits of Modern Data Sharing with ADB

| Benefit                        | Description                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 No duplication needed       | Share data directly from source            |
| ⏱️ Timely insights             | Recipients access fresh data immediately   |
| 🧩 Break down data silos       | Foster cross-team or partner collaboration |
| 🔒 Secure and governed sharing | Controlled access with audit trails        |
| 💰 Monetize your data          | Enable **Data-as-a-Product** strategies    |

## 👥 Roles in Data Sharing

| Role                | Responsibility                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Share Provider**  | Owns the data, defines and grants access to data shares         |
| **Share Recipient** | Receives access to selected data sets; only sees what is shared |

## 🛠️ How It Works in Autonomous Database

* Uses **Delta Sharing API** (open standard)
* Works **across clouds**: Oracle ↔ non-Oracle (e.g. Databricks, AWS)
* Supports:

  * ✅ Local & remote data sharing
  * ✅ Real-time updates via **deltas**
  * ✅ No data movement or duplication

---

## 🧰 Tools for Sharing

### 💻 **Data Studio** (GUI)

* Create, browse, and manage shares
* Discover available datasets
* Preview, filter, and query shared data

### 🧪 **Command Line Tools**

* Automate share creation and consumption
* Integrate with workflows
* Still maintains Oracle’s **governance** (GRANT, REVOKE, AUDIT, TRACK)

## 🌐 Multicloud + Hybrid Sharing

| From → To                                 | Supported?                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Oracle ADB → Oracle ADB                   | ✅ Optimized with Cloud Links |
| Oracle ADB → Non-Oracle (e.g. Delta Lake) | ✅ Open via Delta Sharing API |
| Oracle ADB → Partners, External Clients   | ✅ Secure, governed sharing   |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Oracle Autonomous Database provides a **modern, governed, and open** data sharing capability that works across **databases**, **tools**, and **clouds** — reducing redundancy and enabling secure collaboration.
